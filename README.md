## Structure:

 The structure of the website will contain a homogenous navigation bar that will bw comprised of three button links the first of which will be a link back to the homepage and this will be the companys name, the next link will be the 'meet the team' button which will link to the second page and the third link will be a link called 'enquires' to link to the third page. The navigation bar will be mobile responsive and will change to a drop down menu using the 'burger icon' this will be so it fits nicely on to a smaller screen and easy to use by the users.

 All three pages will be styled using custom CSS/CSS3 as well as using the help from prewritten code such as bootstrap 4, this is so that the users can experience a custom feel to the website and feel welcomed knowing that the company cares what the website looks like to make new users become recurring users. The three pages will also be responsive, this will be done by the use of CSS, bootstrap and media queries. This is so that whether the user is using a mobile device, a tablet or a computer they will be able to see the full width of the website without cutting anything out or having to have a horizontal scroll bar just to see the website.

 The use of media queries will allow the website to shrink to fit any users devices or expand if going from a smaller device to a bigger one. The use of media queries will mean that any element that are set to a certain measurement maybe set to a new measurement on other devices so that it can fit comfortably in the intended screen sizes. The text on pages will not change so that the user can still read the text without having to change their zoom size this being said it may mean that the user may have to scroll vertically depending on the overall size of the amount of text in a specific element.

 The footer element will also be homogeneous as it will be set out to have a 'back to top' button allowing the user to link back to the top of their current page this is so that the user will not have to scroll up their page to get back to the top. Along side this the footer will also include social links to the following sites:

 - Facebook
 - Twitter
 - Instagram
 - Discord

These will all include their respective icons as well as their names. The footer element will also use media queries this is so that when a user browses the site on a mobile device they will not have the names causing them to have to scroll horizontally, they will just be able to see the icons themselves.

 The landing page will be comprised of the nav bar mentioned above as well as a hero image with text inside this box allowing the user to find out a little bit of information about the company and why they have made the website. This will be followed by three slideshow image boxes that will be layed out in a 2 1 formation, this meaning that the first two boxes will be positioned besides eachother with margins to keep the boxes seperated and the third will be centered underneath the two other boxes. This will allow the user to interact with each of them to see different images of games that the current team play. The first of which will contain images of shooting games, the second of which will contain images of racing games and the third of which will contain images of miscellaneous games. The miscellaneous games will consist of random genres of games such as indies, RGPs and more.

 The 'meet the team' page will consist of the header and footers that are previously spoken about as well as a number of boxes consisting of a picture of the team, their setups and a brief description of who they are, what they do and what they play. This will be shown using 3 boxes 1 of the person, the  next will be the text to describe the person and the final will be another image but this time of their set ups. This will follow the same pattern all the way down the page. 

 The 'enquires' page will be made up of the homogeneous header and footer the rest of the page will have another banner image, this will be to reduce the amount of whte space there will be on the final page. As well as the banner there will also be a form on the page this is for the users to get in contact with the team for any of their needs. These could range from just a simple question about a game to asking for a team to play with.
