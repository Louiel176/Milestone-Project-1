# Milestone Project 1

## UX:

### Project goals:

The goal of this website is to create a community that makes users feels welcomed and confident in asking and helping other users with different video games. The landing page will show the user Who the company is and what they want to achieve with the website. The landing page of the site will show a brief description of the current team and a brief description of who they are. The about us page will show the main description of the team as well as use images to show what gaming setups they use and what games they like playing as well as a little description of what they do. This is to show users no matter what they do they can always find comfort in knowing they will always be supported in their gaming hobbies and will be able to find some useful players and make friends along the way. The enquires page will allow users to contact the company about any questions they may have towards games or the company in general.

### User goals:

The target audience for this website are gamers new or old.

The goals of the site are as followed:

- to create a community
- to allow communication between users and the company
- a safe and comfortable enviroment
- to meet the team already apart of the community
- to feel safe communicating with individuals that are used to making friends online and gaming with them

### Developer goals:

- make a friendly and easy to use website
- allow the users to meet the team behind the business
- allow the users to feel comfortable getting in contact
- allow users to contact the company via an enquires page
- allow users to see what the team do for their jobs and hobbies

## Structure:

 The structure of the website will contain a homogenous navigation bar that will bw comprised of three button links the first of which will be a link back to the homepage and this will be the companys name, the next link will be the 'meet the team' button which will link to the second page and the third link will be a link called 'enquires' to link to the third page.

 All three pages will be styled using custom CSS/CSS3 as well as using the help from prewritten code such as bootstrap 4, this is so that the users can experience a custom feel to the website and feel welcomed knowing that the company cares what the website looks like to make new users become recurring users. The three pages will also be responsive, this will be done by the use of CSS, bootstrap and media queries. This is so that whether the user is using a mobile device, a tablet or a computer they will be able to see the full width of the website without cutting anything out or having to have a horizontal scroll bar just to see the website.

 The use of media queries will allow the website to shrink to fit any users devices or expand if going from a smaller device to a bigger one. The use of media queries will mean that any element that are set to a certain measurement maybe set to a new measurement on other devices so that it can fit comfortably in the intended screen sizes. The text on pages will not change so that the user can still read the text without having to change their zoom size this being said it may mean that the user may have to scroll vertically depending on the overall size of the amount of text in a specific element.

 The footer element will also be homogeneous the footer will include social links to the following sites:

 - Facebook
 - Twitter
 - Instagram
 - Discord

These will all include their respective icons as well as their names.

 The landing page will be comprised of the nav bar mentioned above as well as a hero image with text inside this box allowing the user to find out a little bit of information about the company and why they have made the website. When in the desktop view the hero image will be followed by 3 slideshows side by side of eachother. The three slideshow image boxes will be layed out in a 2 1 formation when being used on smaller screen sizes, this meaning that the first two boxes will be positioned besides eachother with margins to keep the boxes seperated and the third will be centered underneath the two other boxes. This will allow the user to interact with each of them to see different images of games that the current team play. The first of which will contain images of shooting games, the second of which will contain images of racing games and the third of which will contain images of miscellaneous games. The miscellaneous games will consist of random genres of games such as indies, RGPs and more.

 The 'meet the team' page will consist of the header and footers that are previously spoken about as well as a number of boxes consisting of a picture of the team, their setups and a brief description of who they are, what they do and what they play. This will be shown using 3 boxes 1 of the person, the  next will be the text to describe the person and the final will be another image but this time of their set ups. This will follow the same pattern all the way down the page. 

 The 'enquires' page will be made up of the homogeneous header and footer the rest of the page. As well as the homogeneous header and footer there will also be a form on the page this is for the users to get in contact with the team for any of their needs. These could range from just a simple question about a game to asking for a team to play with.

### Colour

The color that have been used are contrasting colours so they can stand out and are easy for the user to recognise the different elements. Such as the boxes that surround the text the colors being used are as such #3B413C this is a dark grey that allows for a lighter color text to stand out so the text color that has been choosen to use is #fafafa this is an off white color, this applies to the UX as it allows the user to be able to comfortably read the text on the page. The other colours used are also dark colours with lighter colours that stand out so that they attract the users eyes. The other colours that have been used are as followed:
- rgb(36, 39, 43) this is a grey colour used on the navigation bar and the footer element, the colour used against this is #119822 this is a green that stands out against the background colour. These colours have been reused a few times so that the colours don't variate too much. By reusing these colours it allows for the user to be more comfortable using the website as it means theres not loads of different colours jumping out at the user. 
-  rgba(72, 79, 87, 0.778) this colour has been used for the navigation bar this is to add an interactive element for the user, when the user hovers over one of the navigation buttons it will have the colour stated above come down from the top of the button and cover the button whilst also changing the text colour to #fafafa which is an off white colour. 
- #2D3A3A this colour is used so that the white space left on the website can be coloured and allows for other elements to be used in order the break the page up allowing for an easier read. This has allowed the 'meet the team' page to have been styled and positioned correctly allowing for a more aesthetically pleasing website. 
- rgba(72, 79, 87, 0.9) this colour is used for the element over the hero image so that text can be placed on top without be unreadable the colour uses the alpha unit so that the image is still partly visable to the user while making the text easy to read. The text colour used is the off white colour #fafafa. 
- rgb(51, 56, 62) this colour has also been used as a background colour for headings with a contrasting text colour which is #119822 this is the green that has been used throughout the website.
- rgb(72, 79, 87) this colour has been used for the buttons used on the page to show repetitiveness over the webpage, the buttons use #119822 as the contrasting colour to make the text stand out against the background. The buttons also use the following colours for an interactive element, rgb(51, 56, 62) and #116622 these colour are a darker shade of the colours mentioned above this is so that the user can see when they are hovering over the element.

## Testing

### Bugs

In this project I have come across several bugs that I have needed to fix these are in no particular order but are shown below:

A bug that I have come across was that the cover text over the hero image wasn't showing up properly it was meant to be displaying over the image but didn't show up so I have had to re-size the text and change the text colour this allowed the text to be shown but did not align to the box that the text was in properly and was overflowing the box to change this I had to re-size the box that it was in to make it bigger so that the box had padding around the text allowing the text to fit nicely in the box.

Another bug that I have come across was the use of functionality with slideshow images as they were only appearing with the first image and not showing the other images or allowing the user to scroll through the images provides as shown below:

![Slideshow bug](assets/testing/slideshow%20bug.PNG)

To fix this I have added the javascript functionality provided by providing the link references to jquery, popper.js and bootstrap.min.js by doing this this has allowed the slides to work as its intended purpose.

Another bug that has been encounted due to the sizes of the images are that the first image which was the biggest before has been resized to fit however the other two images have also been resized and they don't fit in the box.

![Slideshow bug](assets/testing/slideshow-bug-resize-CODMW.png)
![Slideshow bug](assets/testing/slideshow-bug-resize-Warzone.png)
![Slideshow bug](assets/testing/slideshow-bug-resize-varlarant.png)

On the footer there has been a reoccuring bug which shows up of the Discord icon not showing up.

![Socials bug](assets/testing/socials-bug.png)

The code being used doesn't allow the discord icon to show on the webpages. To solve this bug a script log has been added to the code, this has allowed the icon to show within the website across all pages.

![Socials fix](assets/testing/socials-fix.png)

Across the whole website specific fonts should have been in use these fonts didn't always show up when using different elements so on the CSS the code has been added to each of the elements where the fonts didn't show up. This has allowed the font to be present throughout the whole website.

## Limitations

Due to the limited use of JavaScript, the only use is from Bootstraps(JS/JQuery) this has meant that the enquiries section has limitations where none of the information sent from users can be saved.

## Features

### Existing features

- Carousel slides - these have been used across two pages the first of which to show different games that the community plays and the second of which shows the teams individual setups. There are 7 slides being used 3 on the landing page and 4 more on the 'meet the team' page.

- Back to top button - this is used across all pages so that instead of the user needing to scroll back to the top of the page they just need to click the button and they will be sent to the top of that page. 

- Contact form - this form is on the 'enquiries' page allowing the user to get in contact with the team for any concerns or questions the may have.

### Future features to impliment

- Sign up page - for the users to join the community team and be able to sign in when they please to.

- Blog page - for users both new and old to communicate freely while being signed in with their personal account or just a guest account so that posts can be saved and will be monitored by senior members of the team. 

- back to top button - this is so that users won't have to scroll up the page to get to the top of the page.

This technology shows randomly generated colours with their hex number/RGB number.

## Testing

Milestone project 1 - The community requires testing to be applied this testing is of the responsiveness, visual and layout of the website. The site does not require the use of back-end functuality however it does require a form so this does not have to link to a server.

### Summary of test on website

The tests that will be done on the website are of the layout of the website making sure that none of the elements of the website over laps another causing the user to be confused due to overlapping text/pictures. 

The site should change due to screen size changes for instance changing from a desktop view to other devices such as tablet or mobile devices. The responsivity of the website should change depending on what screen size is detected. 

The navigation shouldn't change depending on the different screen sizes but the elements should change size to meet the expectation of the user. 

The main navigation links should allow the user to go from one page to the next with a click of a button without opening in a new tab. The only links that should open a new tab will be the external links that are provided for the user to access social links. 

Testing on the form pages will show what fields are required by the user to enter information that the business needs for the user to enter in order to complete the form. As well as checking for this the testing will also show what happens if the user enters incorrect information such as their email address.

### Tests

![Testing screenshot](/assets/testing/testing-screenshot.png)

The tests shown above are to show responsive testing for the change of screen sizes from desktop to tablet to mobile viewing these have been show from each change I.E. the change from desktop to tablet, change from desktop to mobile and so on. Other tests are also shown showing tests for the navigation responsiveness and links, the social links opening new tabs so that user doesn't lose the community website. The tests also show the tests done to the form to make sure the form is responsive when the user misses a field that is required by the website. 

All of the pages containing HTML have been tested using a validator with one reoccuring error taking place which is the use of an button being a decendent of the A attribute so I have decided to remove the code to this section as it is not a crucial part to the website, this being said I shall add this at a later stage when developing the website futher with the correct corrective actions taking place to make this code valid for later use. The HTML validator being used is [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org).

The CSS within the website has also been put in to the with no errors occuring. The CSS validator that has been used is [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

### User testing

In this project I have had a few different kinds of people test my website out, the different kinds of people are, someone that doesn't game, someone that does but doesn't use social media to talk with different gamers and someone that does use social media and other platforms to interact with different gamers. Their feedback is as follows:

#### Non-gamer

The non-gamer has said the website looks good they understand why the colours being used are relevent to the website they have said to me that some of the colours being used contrast with eachother and make it seem like certain colours being used are confusing due to it making the user think that certain colours represent different interactive elements. The website is clear and understandable to know what its purpose is and the purpose of each page.

#### Single player gamer

The single player gamer said that they also understand the purpose of the website and what its intended use is for. They have said that there are reasonable colours being used, that don't overwhelm the user. The user also stated that in future development if the website has a blog/forum page, they may use the website when and if they need help with specific games due to faster responses, friendliness of other players as well as more oportunity to come across a gamer who has spent time getting into specific games that the user maybe enquiring about. The user stated that they like the idea of the enquiries page however the team is small so the team may not have played the game that they are looking to enquire about.

#### Social gamer

The social gamer has said that they like the website and understand the purpose of the website and would like to see how it developes in the future but there are other platforms out there that are more useful for this user. The user has also stated that there could be more information about the team such as their gamer tags and their favourite game/their most frequented game. The user likes the colour scheme and understands the colours being used are colours associated with gaming. They have also said I should do somemore research to see what gamers find useful on platforms built for gamers to communicate between one another and try to impliment similar features.  

### Deployment 

In the deployment of the website a few bugs have arose for instance the deployment is using a previous version of the code that have been pushed to github pages, this includes code that has been taken out and also exclude code that has been recently writen into the webpage. Another issue that has arose has been that none of the images are accessable via the website. To fix the issue with previous code being loaded I've had to save and redeploy my code so that it updates itself while fixing some of the coding issues it has not fixed all of them and continues to use older code on one of the pages, 'meet the team' page still has the back to top button which was taken out of the code due to validation errors. By changing parts of the code and redeploying the code it has allowed for the updated version of the website to be deployed but a few bugs are still showing like displaying images is still showing their alt attributes instead of loading the images themselves.

After changing the code to allow the use of images on the live pages the images now show up this has been done by removing the '/' from the src link to the images. This has allowed for the site to function properly and display the images properly. 

The live deployment of my milestone project 1 is linked below:
[Live page deployment](https://louiel176.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/meet-the-team.html)

The project started by using the given template from code institute and the use of bootstrap 4. The project then using the help of the above mentioned website the project was coded and tested using developement tools to help with the changes to the website. The development tools being used has allowed for certain code to be taken out and allows for the site changes to be viewed in real time instead of having to save and reload the site itself, this allows for quick code changes and re-enabling of valid code. It also allows for changes in screen sizes to show tablet views and mobile views, this allows for the website to be coded using media quiries and to see what changes need to be applied to different size screens.

To deploy the live version of the website github pages have been used to do this go to the github repositories, click on setting, click the pages tab on the left hand side and click save this will deploy a live version of the website. To access the site click on the link provide above on the repositories page. 

## Modifications to the website

From the feedback given to me, I have adjusted the size of the hero image as it was stretched and pixalated so that it is not stretched nor pixalated this meets the user requirements as it means it doesn't take away from the website and distract users. The social links name have been removed due to the popularity of the sites means that most if not all users will recognise the platforms on their icons alone and do not need their names as well, this also makes the website more responsive as it means no matter the sreen size the footer element doesn't have to change size. For instance with the names and the icons when reducing the screen size the footer element increased in height to fit the links on the page. This meets the users requirements as it allows for faster loading times and reduces the amount of elements on the website making it look more developed and easier to use. Another bit of feedback given was that the teams photos of themselves and their setups were being stretched when the screen size is adjusted, this has now been changed by modifying the pictures sizes so that they fit the elements that they are held in better also by changing the element sizes when the screen has been adjusted this has been done using percentages instead of assigning the elements specific px sizes as well as using media quiries to notice when a screen size changes. This meets the users requirments as it allows the website to be more fluid and dynamic allowing the user for a more comfortable experience. Certain elements have had colour changes so that the user can identify different elements such as static elements vs. interactive elements. Some users may resize their web-browsers size on one device so changes have been made accordingly such as removing the use of the px sizing and using percentage sizing instead, this helps reduce aesthetic problems as it allows the website to change its element sizes with the changes in screen/web-browser sizes.
